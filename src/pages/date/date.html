    It's simple. Turn the
    <span>{{pluralnoun1}}</span>
    . Make him/her want
    <span>{{adverb1}}</span>
    to date you. Make sure you're always dressed to
    <span>{{verb1}}</span>
    Each and every day, wear a/an
    <span>{{clothing1}}</span>
    that you know shows off your
    <span>{{bodypart1}}</span>
    to
    <span>{{adjective1}}</span>
    advantage and make your
    <span>{{noun1}}</span>
    look like a million
    <span>{{pluralnoun2}}</span>
    . Even if the two of you make meaningful
    <span>{{bodypart2}}</span>
    contact, don't admit it. No hugs or
    <span>{{pluralnoun3}}</span>
    . Just shake his/her
    <span>{{bodypart3}}</span>
    firmly. And remember, when he/she asks you out, even though a chill may run down your
    <span>{{noun2}}</span>
    and you can't stop your
    <span>{{noun3}}</span>
    from
    <span>{{ingword1}}</span>
    , just play it
    <span>{{adjective2}}</span>
    . Take a long pause before answering in a very
    <span>{{adjective3}}</span>
    voice. "I'll have to
    <span>{{verb2}}</span>
    it over."
